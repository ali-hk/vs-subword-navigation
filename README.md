# Subword navigation for Visual Studio
This adds the missing code navigation feature costing so many developers so much valuable time by selecting parts of words one character at the time or reaching for that pesky mouse. No warranty.

## Usage
Look up Edit.Subword in keyboard bindings to set things up.

## Change Log

### Version 1.4.0
Fixed wonky line transitions, wonky whitespace edge cases and wonky virtual space handling. And VS 2017.

### Version 1.3.0
Now for snaky_people as well, thanks to [SombreErmine](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/sombreermine/)!

### Version 1.2.0
Enabled VS 2015 support again; "works on my machine".

### Version 1.1.1
Corrected a couple of odd behaviors due to having any existing selections. Should now align nicely with Sublime. Thanks [JNF-smile](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/jnf-smile/).
Found what was needed for VS 2015 support. This will have to wait for a bit I'm afraid.

### Version 1.1.0
Added bindings for delete previous/next subword
Took a gamble and enabled installation on VS 2015

### Version 1.0.1
Enabled installation on VS 2013
